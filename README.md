This repository includes all source and constraint files for the VGA Display project. This repository is meant to be a location to easily view the work completed for this project; if the user wishes to run this,
they should download all source and constraint files and add it to their own Vivado project. Please note, that the clock generator clk_wiz_25MHz.xci is an AMD IP block. Thus, the user should download the .xci file and 
perform the necessary setup tasks to have the MMCM wizard auto generate the HDL. This will not work outside of Vivado.
